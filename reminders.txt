🔹 Step 1: Foundation

👉 Focus on the essentials first (you already know some of this, but make sure the basics are solid).

Concepts to master:

useForm() → how it initializes the form (default values, mode).

register() → wiring inputs to form state.

handleSubmit() → handling form submission.

Error handling → formState.errors.

📌 Experiment:
Build a simple login form (email + password). Add validation rules (required, minLength, pattern).

🔹 Step 2: Validation & Error Handling

👉 Once you’re comfortable with the basics, dive deeper into validation.

Concepts:

Validation rules in register().

Custom validation functions.

Error messages.

        Resolver support (Yup, Zod, Joi).

📌 Experiment:

Add confirm-password validation.

Use Yup or Zod with resolver to manage schema-based validation.

🔹 Step 3: Controlled & Uncontrolled Inputs

👉 RHF works best with uncontrolled inputs, but sometimes you’ll need controlled ones.

Concepts:

Controller component.

Integration with UI libraries (Material UI, Chakra, etc).

Handling custom components like date pickers or dropdowns.

📌 Experiment:
Use a 3rd-party UI input (e.g., a date picker) with Controller.

🔹 Step 4: Advanced Form State & Features

👉 Now you’ll explore features that make forms more dynamic.

Concepts:

watch() → dynamically react to values.

setValue() / getValues() → manually update/read values.

reset() → resetting form state.

useFieldArray() → dynamic fields like add/remove items.

useFormContext() + FormProvider → manage multi-step or deeply nested forms.

📌 Experiment:

Build a form with “Add more fields” functionality (like adding multiple addresses).

Create a multi-step form (step 1: personal info, step 2: contact info, step 3: review & submit).

🔹 Step 5: Performance & Best Practices

👉 This is what sets RHF apart.

Concepts:

RHF avoids unnecessary re-renders — learn how.

shouldUnregister vs keeping fields mounted.

Optimizing with useController and form context.

📌 Experiment:
Build a large form and profile performance (use React DevTools to check renders).

🔹 Step 6: Real-World Integration

👉 Tie it all together with external APIs and user flows.

Concepts:

Submitting to backend APIs.

Async validation (e.g., check if username is taken).

Pre-filling forms with data (edit profile form).

📌 Experiment:

Create a signup form that checks username availability from an API before submission.

Create an edit form that pre-fills data and allows updates.
